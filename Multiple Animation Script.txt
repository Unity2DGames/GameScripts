/* we have to make a parameters name state it's gonna be int 
then use enum for index 
every index state need to be equal to the index numbes 
Like :
state =0 for idel ;
every nodes which is return to idle like after jump or run and falling 
like that same follows with others animation

every animation need to off their Has Exit Time and 
need to give the value of Transition Durations 0.
